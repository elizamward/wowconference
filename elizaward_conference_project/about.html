	<p> Women on Web is an annual conference that is now on its 5th year as an event. Each year, we gather together to celebrate the work and success of powerful women in the industry. The previous events have had over 3,000 individuals attend in hopes to learn more about web design and the women behind their favorite websites. This year we will be hosting nine events over the course of a week lead by seven amazing speakers that will help educate women and kids in the DMV area and visitors from across the world. </p>
	<p> The first event of the conference is AI with Zeynep Tufekci. Zeynep is a techno-socilogist who is well-known for her groundbreaking work in emerging technologies in artificial intelligence. At the event she will discuss not only her work in AI but also the work of other women in the field of AI. </p>
	<p> The second event of the conference is Kids that Kode. Young designers in the DMV area will be traveling into the city to discuss their breakthrough into coding. Children are encouraged to go to this event and learn from people just like them. </p>
	<p> The third event of the conference is We Slack with Kristy Tillman. Kristy Tillman is currently serving as the Head of Global Experience at Slack, a groundbreaking community networking program. Kristy will be talking about how her experience at Reebok has led her to success in a large company such as Slack. Kristy will also be available for questions after the event. </p>

	<p> The fifth event of the conference is Gaming for Girls with Zoe Quinn. The video game designer is looking to help girls who are passionate about computer science but do not know where to start. Zoe Quinn will be taking young students from a local school through the steps of learning to code. Outside attendees will be able to attend; however, spots will be limited. </p>
	<p> The sixth event will be attended by all our panelists as they will be work shopping with lucky audience members in creating a package of the members choosing that will help them get started on their web career. </p>
	<p> The seventh event of the conference will be typing together with Nadine Chahine. Chahine created a typeface that is accessible to two different languages. Chahine will discuss the importance of accessibility when it comes to creating typefaces. </p>
	<p> The eighth event of the conference will be hosted by Cindy Cohn who will be refreshing the viewers on their understanding of internet law. Cohn will quiz the audience on their knowledge of internet law and will additionally be answering questions about any of the attendees specific internet law questions. </p>
	<p> The final event that will close out the conference is We Can with Susan Kare. Susan will be closing out the conference with a discussion on not only her rise to success in the 80s, but womenâ€™s rise as a community and what strives need to be taken to continue to gain respect for women in the technology and web design field. </p>
